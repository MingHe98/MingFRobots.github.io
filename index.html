                            <div class="subheading mb-3">Artemis Board Setup</div>
                            <p>After installing ArduinoBLE from the library manager in the Arduino IDE, I loaded and burned the sketch ble_arduino.ino onto the Artemis board from the ble_arduino directory in the codebase, following the instructions provided.</p>
                            <br>
                            <div class="subheading mb-3">Bluetooth Connection</div>
                            <p>After successfully setting up the Artemis board and starting the Jupyter server, the next step was to connect the Artemis board to the Python code. I first needed to read the MAC address of the Artemis board and replace the default MAC address in the Arduino code. After uploading the provided ble_arduino.ino code file to the Artemis board, the MAC address c0:89:f4:6b:86:4b was returned in the serial monitor, as shown in the figure below.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Since the BLEService is used in this lab, in addition to the MAC address, a UUID is also needed to identify the service. This is to differentiate the various types of data sent or received between the Artemis and the computer. Therefore, in the Jupyter Notebook, I ran the following code:
                               <br>
                               <i>from uuid import uuid4</i>
                               <br>
                               <i>uuid4()</i>
                               <br>
                               This generated a unique UUID, which I then assigned to the BLE service in both the Arduino IDE and the Jupyter notebooks.
                            </p>

                            <p>Instead of manually sending a command and then receiving the data, a notification handler could be used to monitor the data transfer. It is an asynchronous event handler, which means it would handle the case when the Artemis board is sending data and then receiving the data in Python.

In the Arduino IDE, I created a loop that, instead of sending each timestamp to the laptop, stored each timestamp in an integer array named time_stamps. By calling the command SEND_TIME_DATA, the Arduino code looped through the array and sent each data point as a string to the laptop for processing. Additionally, the data transfer rate was calculated, which was 411,000 bytes/s. This rate was in contrast to the previous method, which sent each timestamp immediately instead of storing them in an array.

                            <p>Next, as instructed, I added a second array of the same size as the time stamp array to store temperature readings. As shown in the screenshot below, each element in both arrays corresponded, meaning that the first timestamp was recorded at the same time as the first temperature reading. A command, GET_TEMP_READINGS, was introduced to loop through both arrays concurrently and send the data back to the laptop. I was able to configure the notification handler to manage the event and wrote code in Python to parse these strings, populating the data into two lists.

                            <p>The first method involves the Artemis board sending data immediately as it becomes available, without any buffering. The second approach, on the other hand, has the Artemis board buffering data into a packet before sending it to the computer. This method is faster, as indicated by the results above. The Artemis board is equipped with 384 kB of RAM, and considering that one character (char) is equivalent to 1 byte, it has the capacity to store up to 384,000 characters in its memory for transmission without running out of space.

                            <p>Next, I sent messages from the computer and received replies from the Artemis board. I calculated the data rate for 5-byte replies to be about 103 bytes/s and for 120-byte replies to be 1602 bytes/s. Additionally, to understand the relationship between the number of bytes and the data transfer rate, I tested multiple byte replies at intervals of 5. It was observed that the data rate increases with the amount of bytes sent, as depicted in the graph below. This trend indicates that larger replies reduce overhead. However, as shown on the graph, when the byte replies become too largeâspecifically, when they exceed 80 bytesâthe trend might break, and the rate might drop to a lower rate than expected.

                            <p>After installing ArduinoBLE from the library manager in the Arduino IDE, I loaded and burned the sketch ble_arduino.ino onto the Artemis board from the ble_arduino directory in the codebase, following the instructions provided.</p>

                            <p>After successfully setting up the Artemis board and starting the Jupyter server, the next step was to connect the Artemis board to the Python code. I first needed to read the MAC address of the Artemis board and replace the default MAC address in the Arduino code. After uploading the provided ble_arduino.ino code file to the Artemis board, the MAC address c0:89:f4:6b:86:4b was returned in the serial monitor, as shown in the figure below.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Since the BLEService is used in this lab, in addition to the MAC address, a UUID is also needed to identify the service. This is to differentiate the various types of data sent or received between the Artemis and the computer. Therefore, in the Jupyter Notebook, I ran the following code:
                               <br>
                               <i>from uuid import uuid4</i>
                               <br>
                               <i>uuid4()</i>
                               <br>
                               This generated a unique UUID, which I then assigned to the BLE service in both the Arduino IDE and the Jupyter notebooks.

                            The code below demonstrates how I used a notification handler to asynchronously receive the time data sent from the Artemis board.

                            <p>The screenshot below demonstrates that I obtained the current time in milliseconds from the Artemis board and then sent it back to the laptop. After collecting these time values for 3 seconds, I was able to calculate an average speed of how fast messages can be sent. The effective data transfer rate of this method was 832 bytes/s.

                            <p>Next, a new command, SEND_TIME_DATA, was introduced. In the Arduino IDE, I created a loop that, instead of sending each timestamp to the laptop, stored each timestamp in an integer array named time_stamps. By calling the command SEND_TIME_DATA, the Arduino code looped through the array and sent each data point as a string to the laptop for processing. Additionally, the data transfer rate was calculated, which was 411,000 bytes/s. This rate was in contrast to the previous method, which sent each timestamp immediately instead of storing them in an array.

                            <p>Next, as instructed, I added a second array of the same size as the time stamp array to store temperature readings. As shown in the screenshot below, each element in both arrays corresponded, meaning that the first timestamp was recorded at the same time as the first temperature reading. A command, GET_TEMP_READINGS, was introduced to loop through both arrays concurrently and send the data back to the laptop. I was able to configure the notification handler to manage the event and wrote code in Python to parse these strings, populating the data into two lists.

                            <p>The first method involves the Artemis board sending data immediately as it becomes available, without any buffering. The second approach, on the other hand, has the Artemis board buffering data into a packet before sending it to the computer. This method is faster, as indicated by the results above. The Artemis board is equipped with 384 kB of RAM, and considering that one character (char) is equivalent to 1 byte, it has the capacity to store up to 384,000 characters in its memory for transmission without running out of space.

                            <p>Next, I sent messages from the computer and received replies from the Artemis board. I calculated the data rate for 5-byte replies to be about 103 bytes/s and for 120-byte replies to be 1602 bytes/s. Additionally, to understand the relationship between the number of bytes and the data transfer rate, I tested multiple byte replies at intervals of 5. It was observed that the data rate increases with the amount of bytes sent, as depicted in the graph below. This trend indicates that larger replies reduce overhead. However, as shown on the graph, when the byte replies become too largeâspecifically, when they exceed 80 bytesâthe trend might break, and the rate might drop to a lower rate than expected.

In the screenshot attached below, we can see that the data is reliable by comparing the data sent from the Artemis board and the data received on the laptop.
